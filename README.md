Alfido Tech Internship Tasks completed

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
<p>Titanic Survival Prediction is a classic data science project based on the Titanic
dataset, which contains information about passengers who were on board the
Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The goal is to build a predictive
model that can predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic
disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.
This project typically involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis
(EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning. You'll use algorithms like
logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests for prediction.</p>

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction
<p>Movie Rating Prediction is a project where you aim to build a
recommendation system that predicts how a user would rate a
movie based on their historical ratings and the ratings of similar
users.
This project involves data collection, data cleaning, and
implementing recommendation algorithms. Common algorithms
used include user-based collaborative filtering, item-based
collaborative filtering, or matrix factorization techniques.

### 3. Iris Flower Classification
<p>Iris Flower Classification is a classic machine learning task used for
learning and practicing classification algorithms. The dataset contains
features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width
for three different species of iris flowers.
This project involves data preprocessing, model selection, and
evaluation. You can use classification algorithms like logistic
regression, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), or support
vector machines (SVM) for this classification task.
